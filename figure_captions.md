**Figure 1.** Snapshots of the simulated industrial assembly cell in RoboDK v5.9 (controlled via MATLAB R2025a). Six time points illustrating dynamic cycle allocation for a single human operator, annotated with floating labels for fatigue and skill levels.

**Figure 2.** Material Delivery role: human operator using pallet jack to load raw components.

**Figure 3.** Tray Loading role: operator placing color-coded trays of workpieces onto the conveyor.

**Figure 4.** Part Transfer role: operator removing completed assemblies from the conveyor.

**Figure 5.** HMI Supervision role: operator interacting with the human–machine interface for real-time parameter adjustments.

**Figure 6.** Quality Inspection role: operator visually inspecting finished parts for dimensional accuracy.

**Figure 7.** Packaging Preparation role: operator organizing inspected components into shipping boxes.

**Figure 8.** Fatigue accumulation over auction cycles: raw mean per-cycle fatigue (blue) and 100-cycle moving average (orange).

**Figure 9.** Robot utilization rate across auction cycles: raw percentage of active cycles (blue) with 100-cycle moving average (orange).

**Figure 10.** Collision incidence scatter: plot of collision events by episode (y-axis) and cycle index (x-axis), highlighting both dense clusters and sparse occurrences.

**Figure 11.** (a) Active cycle distribution by episode: boxplots of robot-active cycles·min⁻¹; (b) fatigue distribution per cycle by episode: boxplots of operator fatigue (units·cycle⁻¹).

**Figure 12.** Parameter sensitivity curves: three-tile layout showing how ±10 % variations in auction frequency, fatigue rate, and bid weights affect (top) active cycle throughput (cycles·min⁻¹), (middle) mean fatigue per cycle (units·cycle⁻¹), and (bottom) safety rate (%).
